From the dataset, professionals, computer programmers and executives top the list of loans taken, it also showed that income range within $25,000 - $49,999 had the highest amount of loans, followed behing closely by the $50,000 - $74,999 range.. It also shows the more amount of loan taken the lower the annual interest rate.
A positive correlation was obeserved with Estimated Effective Yield with our variable of interest (BorrowerAPR) another interesting correlation was a positive one between the Original Loan Amount and the monthly loan payment, another obervation was a negative correlation between the Prosper Rating (Alpha) with our variable of interest (BorrowerAPR).
In conclusion, the HR ratings had a higher borrower annual interest rate compared to the AA with the least borrower annual interest rate.
